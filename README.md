FizzBuzz TDD Kata
=================

This is a programming "kata" where the the main point of the exercise is not to solve the problem itself but to do it repeatedly in order to master the tools you are using. 

Makers Academy challenge was to do this in under 5 minutes and record a screencast as evidence!
